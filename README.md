# Dementia Classification through Magnetic Resonance Imaging

### Abstract

Image Classification is a field that has found its way into many different aspects of our life, including automated photo organization, image searching, facial recognition, and marketing research. There is no shortage of its uses, and we believe that image classification can make its way into the medical field as well.

Alzheimer’s, a neurodegenerative disease with no cure, is generally detected using MRIs and self-reported symptoms. However, misdiagnoses often occur because symptoms of old age and Alzheimer’s overlap, and examining brain tissue for a clear diagnosis can only be done post mortem.1 In hopes to better this process, we built a neural network model to classify severity levels of Alzheimer’s dementia to help doctors take a second look and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. To do this, we used MRI image sets with 4 classes and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) of both from-scratch and transfer learning methods. The method we found that most accurately predicted Alzheimer’s classes from MRI scans was a from-scratch CNN.
